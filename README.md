# House price prediction

The next project was created by team of three students in the same Data Science Program. The objective was to predict the house price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The Kaggle dataset was used for this project. The Project was a training camp for features engineering, data pipelining, Regression models selection, hyperparameters tuning and optimization. The winner of the tough competition became the Gradient Boosting Regressor which gave the best result and got the submission rank of 1,340 out of 4,632, e.g. within top 30%.
